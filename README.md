# Block Site

**Block Site** (formerly known as Stop Social Media) is a simple Chrome extension that improves your productivity by blocking access to distracting websites as you specify.

### Usage

To configure, click on the **B** icon in the toolbar and select **Options** from the menu. Enter sites in the textbox, leaving a new line for each site, like this:

```
facebook.com
instagram.com
youtube.com
!music.youtube.com
twitter.com
reddit.com
!reddit.com/r/MachineLearning
```

Sites starting with `!` will be exception to the rule, allowed.

Choose what should be done when you try to visit a blocked site, options are:
<ol type="A">
<li>Close Tab</li>
<li>Show Blocked info page (page that shows an information about the blocked site)</li>
</ol>

Last but not least, see a checkbox to enable/disable the blocking.
